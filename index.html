                    If you are reading this message then I am surely gone. This record shall serve as the diary of my last days enduring this captivity. I’m unsure when my captivity began for the days are irregular. The sun never rises or sets. One moment it is there, and the next it simply is not. However, I recall the warm beaches of home where I used to frolic, but only because this strange prison is a twisted mockery of the land of my youth.

                     Food and water are provided for me in generous supply, in gigantic tubs wider across than I am tall. And though they are filled to the brim I feel no satisfaction in what I eat. The food is dry and tasteless and the water is stale. And always, as I eat, they watch me. And though I have tried I have found escape to be impossible. The imitation of home’s beaches is contained within some sort of strange invisible force field, keeping me from escape. Now I stay inside my shelter recording these last moments.

                    My captors are strange titans; pale, fleshy, and devoid of covering. I once bit the hands of one as they lifted me from my prison and into the air. Somehow, perhaps God’s mercy, I managed to survive the fall to the sand and now I pray these alien creatures will not seek retribution against me.

                    I guard my shelter jealously. I know that they always watch, and I often retreat into it just to escape their strange sunken eyes. Though now I have lived in this curious prison long enough that I have outgrown the shelter I used when I arrived. My captors have provided new ones at each stage of my growth.

                    Today death almost came for me. I am a coward, though, as I could not embrace my demise at the last moment. I weep knowing what I’ve given up. They came to me today with a new shelter as my old one grew too small for me. When I thought they were not looking I tried to crawl out of my shell to the new one.

                    As I scuttled, the titan whom I bit reached out for me and plucked me from the sand. Oh, that it had dropped me to my death! I stared into its strange flat face, devoid of eye stalks. I do not know how these monsters eat, for its mouth (I presume it to be a mouth) is devoid of flagellum to feed the food into its gaping maw.

                    For a brief moment we considered each other – I, my heart stopping, and it with an inscrutable expression. Finally, gently even, the titan left me on the sand. I scuttled to the new shell and have hidden there since. This is where you will find my message, though if you are reading this you are surely captive even as I am.

                    May God have mercy and deliver the escape of death.
